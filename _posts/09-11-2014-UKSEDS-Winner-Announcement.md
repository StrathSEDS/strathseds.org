At long last the winner of the 2014 UKSEDS National Rocketry Championships were announced this last week and to our great joy, our StrathSEDS rocket "Just Launching" siezed the day!

The rocket managed to reach a respectable altitude of 987.6 m after only 14.75 s with a top speed of 272 m/s before gracefully coming to rest a tad over a minute later. It was a great achievement for us and we're looking forward to seeing what's in store for the 2015 competition! After such a succesful attempt this time, we may just have to push the boundaries on the next one...

A massive thankyou to UKSEDS for hosting such a fantastic event and providing an invaluable opportunity to apply our technical knowledge to a field we all take great interest in (oddly enough!). An extended thank you again to those at Teal Engineering who gladly offered the tools we required for construction of "Just Testing", your assistance was much appreciated along with the countless others who offered their time and knowledge to help us develop and build a truly incredible rocket and another massive thank you to all those who helped organize and bring the competition to fruition. Activities like these play a vital role in helping younger generations pursue careers in the space industry and allowing the current generation of students to apply their knowledge in inspiring and interesting ways outside of the lecture theatres.
