Charlotte L&uuml;cking will present her work on a passive de-orbiting strategy for high altitude CubeSat missions using a deployable reflective balloon as part of a student scholorship competition at the 25th Annual AIAA/USU Conference on Small Satellites

![AIAA Poster][AIAA-Poster]An explanation of the orbital dynamics of the method and an analysis of its efficiency can be found in the following paper:
