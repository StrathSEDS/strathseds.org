StrathSEDS is working on an electric propulsion project by designing, building and testing a propulsion unit called a Pulsed Plasma Thruster (PPT). Electrical propulsion units are a large area of research and growth in aerospace due to the high propellant efficiency levels achieved, leading to reduced propellant mass. PPTs are one of the simplest forms of electric propulsion and may find uses in CubeSats and other larger satellites for many purposes, including station-keeping and de-orbiting.
